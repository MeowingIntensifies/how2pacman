Hi
If you want to see how code would look like if monkeys could code, then you've come to the right place!
(No, seriosly im a begginer so it might look awful. )
This is a  college pacman-alike  game project. Work in progress. OC (mostly) code donut steel 
What are the differences : 
- there is more than one map ( whole 5 in fact)
- maps are in different sizes
- due to smaller maps, ghost parameters and amount is adjustable
- Chase-scatter routine and Ghost House won't be in the game (see point above)
